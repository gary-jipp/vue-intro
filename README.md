# vue-intro

Here we expanded on the Box component, adding mouse event handlers  and style binding
We also demonstrated props binding in the App component and dynamic binding to data items

Note that v-bind:style can also be written as just :style .  The "v-bind" is implied
Similarily, @vmouseover is shorthand for v-on.mouseOver .  All "v-on" events can be shortened this way
