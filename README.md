# vue-intro

Modified the Box component to include a <slot> element to hold additional content besides "text"
Using slots is a often good idea as it gives you more flexibility and room to expand.

Used v-for to build the Box array using a single boxColor v-bind and an array of boxData items
The boxData array could come from any dataSource

Note: we can use "in" or "of" interchangably in the v-for directive. It's just a personal 
preference if you want to align with JavaScript's "for" syntax
