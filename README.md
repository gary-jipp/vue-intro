# vue-intro

Part 1 contains a new Vue project more or less as you would get it from the Vue CLI
using vue create.  I have removed some extraneous content from the HelloWorld Component


## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
